# HW1

For each problem I want you to submit to me at least three files:
* A file with your code in it that will compile, and that you feel solves the problem (or as ar as you got in that process.)
* A file with test cases you used to see if your program is working (needs at least 5 unique tet cases.)
* Anwers for your test cases.  This can be a file with what the expected output is for the input file, or A file with the test cases from the previous file, and the answer per case on the line following that case.


## Discussion

You can discuss approaches to the problems with anyone.  I strongly suggest that you do not share your code except by pulling up what you have handed into the class repo.


## Due

These programs will be due no earlier than Mon 26th.  We will talk about the due date on the 19th.
