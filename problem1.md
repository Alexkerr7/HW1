# Problem 1

You have a friend who has a lot of files where each one contains the results from a race.  These files do not have a standard naming system.  
However you do know the names of the races, and also that each race puts it's name in the file name for it's results.

The races your friend is interested in are:
BunRun
Zombie
Boston
Spartan
Mud

There happen to have an index file of all the file names.  Your friend is willing totype these names in on the command line to your program.  

They are asking you to find all file names that contain exactly one of the names of the races, and print them to the screen so they can find them.

Here is a small sampling of the list of races:

2014_Mud-run_for_fun.xml
Spartan_run_in_the_Mud.doc
Boston-Marathon_2019
Bun_Run_In_The_Sun.pdf


Bonus:
1.  Get your program to give an option to print either the file names that contain exactly one of the race names, or any/multiple of the race names.
2.  Your friend has found an additional batch of files that are in folders.  Look for the race names, ignoring any characters before the last '/' in the file name:
