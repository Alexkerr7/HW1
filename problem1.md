# Problem 1

You have a friend who has a lot of files where each one contains the results from a race.  These files do not have a standard naming system.  
However you do know the names of the races, and also that each race puts it's name in the file name for it's results.

The races your friend is interested in are:
BunRun


There happen to have an index file of all the file names.  Your friend is willing totype these names in on the command line to your program.  

They are asking you to find all file names that contain exactly one of the names of the races.
